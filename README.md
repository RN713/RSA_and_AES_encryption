# RSA_and_AES_encryption
 This code implements an encryption using Python. The provides functionality for both AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) encryption , decryption and key generation algorithms. 


#RSA use  asymmetric key.

#ٍُِAES use symmetric key
 
#In the encryption section, the original plaintext message is encrypted using AES in CBC mode. The plaintext is padded to the appropriate block size using PKCS7 padding. The ciphertext is then printed as the output. 

#In the decryption section, the ciphertext is decrypted using AES in CBC mode with the same key and IV. The decrypted data is then unpadded to remove the PKCS7 padding. The resulting plaintext message is printed as the output.
